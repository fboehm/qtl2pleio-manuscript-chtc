The files that we placed on the squid server are too large to include in a Github repository. However, the squid server is publicly accessible. An interested user can find the two needed files at:

http://proxy.chtc.wisc.edu/SQUID/fjboehm/R11.tar.gz

and 

http://proxy.chtc.wisc.edu/SQUID/SLIBS.tar.gz
